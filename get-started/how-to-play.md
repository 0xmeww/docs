## 🎯 Core Gameplay Loop

At its heart, Meww Universe is a casual simulation game that emphasizes player choice, stat management, and world interaction. The main activities include:

- **Feeding the Cat**: Feed your cat whenever needed to restore energy, health, or reduce stress, particularly after participating in mining activities or mini-games.
- **Exploration**: Navigate through various areas and interact with objects or NPCs to uncover new storylines and gameplay features.
- **Resource Management**: Monitor your stats and use your inventory wisely to stay active and efficient.

## 🐱 Feeding System

Feeding is a flexible mechanic used to support recovery after gameplay activities. Each food item has its own tier and recovery value. For example:

- **Burger**: Restores health
- **Mineral Water**: Replenishes energy
- **BlessPotion**: Slows down stress buildup or improves resilience in dungeons

Feeding is not limited to daily caps—players are free to use food items as needed based on their strategy and situation.

## 🧠 Stats and Conditions

Your character has three core status attributes:

- **Energy**: Depleted by actions like mining or participating in mini-games
- **Health**: Depleted by actions like mining or participating in mini-games
- **Stress**: Builds up with continuous actions and reduces efficiency if not managed

Stat recovery can be achieved through feeding, resting, or using utilities found in NFT-based homes (coming soon).

## 🗺️ Interaction and Objects

Many objects in the game world are interactive. Key examples include:

- **Bed**: Reduces stress over time
- **PC**: Opens access to game interfaces or mini-games
- **Table**: Functions as a temporary access point for your inventory. In future updates, a dedicated inventory box system will be introduced.
- **Door**: Serves as a transition point to enter new areas such as the Townhall. Additional zones and objects will be added progressively throughout development.

The interaction system is designed to be intuitive, with on-screen prompts when you're near a usable object.

## 🏆 Leveling and Rewards

By interacting, feeding, and completing activities, players gain experience points (EXP). Upon leveling up, rewards may include:

- In-game currency
- Higher-tier food items
- Special cosmetics or decorative gear
- Titles based on progression (e.g., "Beta Tester", "Explorer")

NPCs will distribute rewards and recognize your progress as part of the evolving narrative.
