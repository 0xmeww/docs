## 🧭 Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Players must first connect a compatible Web3 wallet to access the game. Wallet authentication ensures secure user identity, enables reward tracking, and allows seamless integration with game systems that utilize blockchain-backed assets.

> ⚠️ During the development phase, only selected wallets are supported (e.g., MetaMask). In the future, we plan to support social login methods such as Privy for broader accessibility.

## 👤 Step 2: Create Your Profile

Upon successful wallet connection, the game automatically creates a user profile. Each player profile is uniquely associated with a wallet address and contains data such as:
- Username
- Level and experience
- Inventory
- Energy, health, and stress stats

Profiles are stored securely in the backend and retrieved upon login.

## 🐾 Step 3: Enter the Meww Universe

Once your profile is created, you are placed in your starter environment. This is where your journey begins. Your initial objectives include:
- Feeding your cat when necessary to recover health, energy, or reduce stress
- Exploring your immediate surroundings
- Familiarizing yourself with interactive objects such as beds, PCs, and tables
